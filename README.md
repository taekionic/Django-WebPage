# Django WebPage
 A Django application developed during the first live project at the Tech Academy. Created within the agile framework, during this project I created a mockup personal website with user-authentication, API newsfeed, a blog section with comments, and a minamilistic homepage.
 
 During this project, I leveraged many core Django concepts including class-based and mathod-based views, data-scraping with beautiful soup and API queries to external APIs to relay weather information as well as display a newfeed.
